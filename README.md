Implementation of Different Regression Models

My code is in a single ipynb file (jupyter notebook) which makes for easy viewing of my output as well as results. 

Ten regression analysis have been performed and the linear ones fared better than others in regards to computing cost. In order for the code to be run, i do require datasets which are saved as csv files in the same folder the program is.
Ten functions are available where each run one after the other. 

Starting with the first regression, The data looks something like a delimited jumble. I have already given the function to call and use this data. Therefore i need to execute the cell to look at the out put and move on to the next cell. 

Regression analysis refers to a method of mathematically sorting out which variables may have an impact.We can investigate associations between two or more variables using Regression. It is a mathematical way to classify which variables have an impact. This was my underlying motivation to have picked up this project.
