Implementation of Different Regression Models

My code is in a single ipynb file (jupyter notebook) which makes for easy viewing of my output as well as results. 

Ten regression analysis have been performed and the linear ones fared better than others in regards to computing cost. In order for the code to be run, i do require datasets which are saved as csv files in the same folder the program is.

Starting with the first regression, The data looks something like a delimited jumble. I have already given the function to call and use this data. Therefore i need to execute the cell to look at the out put and move on to the next cell.
